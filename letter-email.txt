Hello,

I am an anthropologist and researcher from Buenos Aires, Argentina now living with my husband in Oakland, California. I have conducted research for corporate, non-profit and startups clients using ethnographic research to understand fundamental human behavior through observation and in-depth interviews as well as other qualitative techniques.

The position listed on your site for Ethnographer interests me greatly and I am writing to apply.

As requested I have prepared three brief reviews of previous ethnographic research. This review can be read at this URL:

I have also prepared a document describing "one product, service or experience [I would] love to take a crack at developing, disrupting or transforming" which can be read at this URL:

My resume is attached to this email and available at this URL:

Hasta pronto,
Clara Gonzalez Sueyro
